# Remove Duplicate from a List

## Problem Description:

You are given a list of integers. Write a Python program that removes any duplicate elements from the list and returns a new list with only unique elements. The order of elements in the list should be maintained.

### Parameters:

* `lst` (List of integers): The list of integers from which duplicates should be removed.

### Returns:

A list of integers where all duplicates have been removed, preserving the original order.

### Example:

```
Input: lst = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
```
Input: lst = [4, 5, 5, 4, 6, 7]
Output: [4, 5, 6, 7]
```

> Note: Please don't use set or inbuilt functions. Try to use brute force logic.

## Solution:

The solution is implemented [here](./code.py).
