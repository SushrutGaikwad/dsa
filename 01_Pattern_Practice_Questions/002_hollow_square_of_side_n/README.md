# Hollow Square of Side `n`

## Problem Description

You are given an integer `n`. Your task is to return a hollow square pattern of size `n` Ã— `n` made up of the character `'*'`, represented as a list of strings. The hollow square has `'*'` on the border, and spaces `' '` in the middle (except for side lengths of `1` and `2`).

### Input Parameters

* `n` (int): The size of the square (number of rows and columns).

### Output

* A list of strings where each string is a row of `n` characters, representing a hollow square.

### Examples

#### Example 1

Input: `3`\
Output: `['***', '* *', '***']`

#### Example 2

Input: `5`\
Output: `['*****', '*   *', '*   *', '*   *', '*****']`
