# Right Angled Triangle II

## Problem Description:

You are given an integer `n`. Your task is to return a right-angled triangle pattern of `'*'`, where each row contains stars aligned to the right. The `1`-st row has `1` star, the `2`-nd row has `2` stars, and so on, until the `n`-th row has `n` stars.

### Input:

* A single integer `n`, where `1 <= n <= 100`.

### Output:

* A list of strings where each string represents a row in the right-angled triangle, right-aligned.

### Example:

```
Input: 4
Output: ['   *', '  **', ' ***', '****']
```
```
Input: 3
Output: ['  *', ' **', '***']
```

## Solution:

The solution is implemented [here](./code.py).
