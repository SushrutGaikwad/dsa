# Area of a Rectangle

## Problem Description:

You are given the length and breadth of a rectangle. Your task is to compute and return the area of the rectangle.

### Formula:

To calculate the area of a rectangle, use the following formula:

$$
\text{Area of a rectangle}=\text{length} \times \text{breadth}
$$

### Input:

* Two floating-point numbers, `length` and `breadth`, representing the dimensions of the rectangle.

### Output:

* A floating-point number representing the area of the rectangle.

### Example:

```
Input: length = 5, breadth = 3
Output: 15.0
```
```
Input: length = 7.5, breadth = 2.4
Output: 18.0
```

## Solution:

The solution is implemented [here](./code.py).
