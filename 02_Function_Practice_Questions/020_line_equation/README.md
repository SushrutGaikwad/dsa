# Line Equation

## Problem Description:

You are given the slope $m$ and the $y$-intercept $b$ of a line, along with a value $x$. Your task is to calculate and return the value of $y$ using the equation of a line in slope-intercept form:

$$
y = mx + b
$$

### Input:

* Three floating-point numbers: `slope`, `intercept`, and `x`.

### Output:

A floating-point number representing the value of `y` corresponding to the given `x`.

### Example:

```
Input: slope = 2, intercept = 3, x = 4
Output: 11.0
```
```
Input: slope = 1.5, intercept = -2, x = 2
Output: 1.0
```

## Solution:
